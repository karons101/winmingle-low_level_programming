0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

This project focuses on advanced C programming concepts including pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, and re-implementing common string manipulation functions found in the standard C library.

The key learning objectives are to gain a deeper understanding of how memory is organized and manipulated directly using pointers, and how to navigate complex data structures like $8\times8$ matrices (chessboards) and other arrays.

All functions were developed adhering to the constraints: no global variables, max 5 functions per file, and using _putchar for character output in function implementations.

Learning Objectives

What pointers to pointers are and how to use them.

How multidimensional arrays are stored in memory and how to access their elements.

Re-implementation of standard C library functions (memset, memcpy, strchr, strspn, strpbrk, strstr).

Variable scope for arrays and pointers.
