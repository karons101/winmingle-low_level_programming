0x08. C - Recursion

This project explores the concept of recursion in C programming. The primary challenge is to solve problems, including string manipulation and mathematical calculations, using recursive function calls exclusively, without the use of any explicit loops (for, while) or static variables.

Learning Objectives

What is recursion: A process where a function calls itself.

How to implement recursion: Defining a base case (stopping condition) and a recursive step (the function calling itself with a modified input).

Situations for recursion: Problems that can be broken down into smaller, identical subproblems (e.g., factorials, Fibonacci sequences, tree traversal).

Situations against recursion: Problems requiring deep call stacks (potential for stack overflow) or those where an iterative (loop-based) solution is simpler or more memory-efficient.

Constraints Implemented

No use of for or while loops.

No use of standard library functions like printf or puts.

All output handled via _putchar.
