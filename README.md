Project: winmingle-low_level_programming (Module 2)

This repository contains mandatory and advanced solutions for Module 2 of the WinMingle C Training Program. The tasks focus on mastering C fundamentals and low-level programming requirements, specifically:

Variable declaration and printing (char, int, unsigned int).

Control flow using if, else, and else if statements.

Iteration using the while loop.

Usage of arithmetic, logical, and relational operators.

Character handling using putchar and understanding ASCII.


# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## WinMingle Community Software Engineering Training Program

This project contains the solutions for **Module 2: Variables, If, Else, and While** as part of the WinMingle Community Software Engineering Program. The focus is on mastering fundamental low-level C concepts, including:

* Variable declaration, assignment, and printing.
* Control flow using conditional statements (`if`, `else`).
* Iterative loops (`while`).
* Understanding and manipulating characters using the ASCII character set.
