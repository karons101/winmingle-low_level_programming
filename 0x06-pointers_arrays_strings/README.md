# 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

This project focuses on understanding and manipulating **pointers**, **arrays**, and **strings** in C programming. It involves implementing custom functions that mimic standard library functions like `strcat`, `strncat`, `strncpy`, and `strcmp`, as well as functions for array manipulation and string encoding/modification (uppercase, capitalization, leet, rot13). The tasks are completed using only low-level tools, specifically forbidding standard library functions such as `printf` and `puts`, except where explicitly allowed for testing in provided `main.c` files. The `_putchar` function is used for character output.

### Learning Objectives

* What are **pointers** and how to use them.
* What are **arrays** and how to use them.
* The differences between **pointers** and **arrays**.
* How to use and manipulate **strings** (which are character arrays).
* The **scope of variables** in C.
